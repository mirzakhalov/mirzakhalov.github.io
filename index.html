                        <p>I am a senior undergraduate at the University of South Florida majoring in Computer Science. I have a particular interest in the application of neuro-inspired approaches to natural language tasks such as text summarization, natural language inference (NLI) and analogical reasoning, with the goal of reaching human-like sophistication in dialogue systems. I am planning to pursue a Ph.D. in a related area. </p>
                        <p> I conduct undergraduate research in Social Computing Research Lab led by Dr. Sriram Chellappan, where I apply Machine Learning and NLP techniques in the context of public epidemiology, cyber empathy and education</p>
                        <p>Previously, I have had an opportunity to explore a variety of research areas. During Summer 2019, I interned at IBM Research under the supervision of Dr. Rong Chang in Financial Services (FSS) team. My work involved creating a general purpose framework for automatic build, deployment and migration of ML capabilities through API Services. Through my sophomore year, I worked and contributed to projects related to Use of Gamification in Epidemiology led by Dr. Ryan Carney and Brain Drone Race Simulation led by Dr. Marvin Andujar.</p>
                        <p>I also serve as an officer at Society of Competitive Programmers, and attend hackathons all around the country. Apart from all that, you will catch me playing soccer on weekends with USF Intramurals team.</p>
